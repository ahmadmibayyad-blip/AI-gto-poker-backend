# OpenAI Regional Restriction Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Error: "Country, region, or territory not supported" (403)

### What This Means
Your current IP address is located in a region where OpenAI services are not available. This is a common issue for users in certain countries or regions.

### ✅ Solution Already Implemented
The application has been updated with a **robust fallback system** that automatically handles this situation:

1. **Primary**: Attempts OpenAI API call
2. **Fallback**: If OpenAI fails, automatically switches to local GTO engine
3. **Result**: Users still get poker analysis results

### 🔧 How to Fix the Regional Restriction

#### Option 1: Use VPN (Recommended)
- Connect to a VPN server in a supported region (US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia)
- Supported regions: https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries
- Restart your application after connecting

#### Option 2: Check Environment Configuration
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

#### Option 3: Test API Connectivity
Run the test script to diagnose:
```bash
node test-openai.js
```
